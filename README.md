# Lettertray
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ello/lettertray.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ello/lettertray)

A self-hosted disposable e-mail service (think Mailinator) making use of the Sendgrid Parse API (and others via Griddler)

# Background

When running end-to-end or integration tests, we've found that it's sometimes
necessary to send live e-mail and be able to pick it up programmatically. There
are a lot of disposable e-mail services out there, but relatively few have APIs
you can use to pick up your mail programmatically.
[Mailinator](http://mailinator.com) does have an API, but it's strange to work
with and somewhat unreliable.

Lettertray gives you a similar service, but lets you host it yourself.

## Requirements
- Ruby 2.3 (or newer)
- Rails 4.1
- A Redis instance (incoming e-mails are stored in Redis temporarily, then
  expired every 5 minutes)

## Installation (for Heroku)
- Clone this repo locally: `git clone git@github.com:ello/lettertray.git`
- Set up a new Heroku app and push to it: `heroku create <my-lettertray-instance> && git push heroku master`
- Configure a secret key for the app: `heroku config:set SECRET_KEY_BASE=\`rake secret\``
- Configure the Sendgrid starter addon: `heroku addons:add sendgrid`
- Configure an inbound parse API redirect in the Sendgrid addon settings. You'll
  need to customize your MX records as well, but the URL will be
  `https://your-heroku-app.herokuapp.com/email_processor`
- Add a Redis addon to your Heroku app (many are available, any of them should
  work)
- Send e-mails, retrieve from the API at 
  `https://your-heroku-app.herokuapp.com/messages.json?email=<address>`
